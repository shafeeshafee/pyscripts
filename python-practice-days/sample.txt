A boy sat on the edge of a dream, dangling his legs over the abyss of sleep.
He had always known the stars had teeth, but tonight they were smiling at him.
“Come,” they seemed to say, “we have been waiting.”
The boy hesitated, as one does when stepping off the edge of something important.
But the air was thick with the smell of forgotten stories, and he couldn’t resist.
He fell, but the wind caught him, cradling him like a mother who never truly left.
Down he drifted, past shadows that flickered with faces, names long lost to time.
In the distance, a door stood alone in the dark, its wood groaning as if alive.
The boy walked toward it, each step pulling him closer to a memory he hadn’t lived yet.
Behind the door, laughter echoed, but not the kind that comforts.
He knocked, because that’s what you do when you don’t know what waits on the other side.
It swung open without a sound, revealing nothing but more darkness.
"Hello?" he called, his voice barely more than a whisper.
And then something answered, from deep within the void.
"We've been expecting you."
The boy smiled.
It was time.
